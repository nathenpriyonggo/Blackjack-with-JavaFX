# Blackjack Game Project

### Overview
This project involves creating a JavaFX application for playing a game of blackjack against a computer opponent.
The game has two players - a banker (computer) and a user, and the user interacts with the game through a graphical user interface (GUI).
The project includes both a JavaFX front end and a Java back end.
